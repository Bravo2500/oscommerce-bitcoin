Python with modules: MySQLdb and simplejson

the existing one so if you or any addons have modified that page, you'll want to merge 
our changes).

2. Enable Bitcoin Payment module

3. Fill in bitcoind RPC host:port, user, password, and create a random notification key

4. Create BTC currency in osCommerce administration -> Localization -> Currencies with 
the following settings. For Value enter # of BTC a USD would buy you.

outside the web root)

6. Copy ./script/default_settings.py to ./script/settings.py and configure at least 
BASE_PATH and OSC_URL

in .bitcoin/bitcoin.conf

You can 'tail -f ./scripts/monitor.log' to follow what the monitor script is doing.
